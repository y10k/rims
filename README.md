Tutorial
--------

Something to need for RIMS setup are following:

* IP address of your server to run RIMS.
* At least one pair of username and password.
* Your e-mail client that can use IMAP.

In this tutorial, IP address is `192.168.56.101`, username is `foo`,
and password is `bar`.

### First step

Let's try to start RIMS. Type following on your console. And some
messages are shown at console.

    $ bundle exec rims server -u foo -w bar
    I, [2015-01-24T21:02:37.030415 #24475]  INFO -- : start server.
    I, [2015-01-24T21:02:37.035052 #24475]  INFO -- : open socket: 0.0.0.0:1430
    I, [2015-01-24T21:02:37.036329 #24475]  INFO -- : opened: [AF_INET][1430][0.0.0.0][0.0.0.0]
    I, [2015-01-24T21:02:37.036569 #24475]  INFO -- : process ID: 24475
    I, [2015-01-24T21:02:37.037105 #24475]  INFO -- : process privilege user: toki(1000)
    I, [2015-01-24T21:02:37.037401 #24475]  INFO -- : process privilege group: toki(1000)

Add e-mail account to your e-mail client:

* Username is `foo`.
* IMAP server is `192.168.56.101`. This may be replaced to your server
  hostname or IP address.
* IMAP port number is `1430`. This is default of RIMS.
* IMAP authentication password is `bar`.

If setup is success, empty mailbox named INBOX is shown at new mail
account of your e-mail client.

Last, type Ctrl+C on your console to stop server.

### Configuration file

Password at command line parameter is insecure because password is
peeped from another user using `ps aux`. Username and password should
be written at configuration file.

RIMS configuration file format is YAML. Type following in file of
`config.yml` and save.

```yaml
user_list:
  - { user: foo, pass: bar }
```

And start RIMS with `-f config.yml` option.

    $ bundle exec rims server -f config.yml
    I, [2015-01-26T23:20:24.573462 #6106]  INFO -- : start server.
    I, [2015-01-26T23:20:24.574507 #6106]  INFO -- : open socket: 0.0.0.0:1430
    I, [2015-01-26T23:20:24.581892 #6106]  INFO -- : opened: [AF_INET][1430][0.0.0.0][0.0.0.0]
    I, [2015-01-26T23:20:24.582044 #6106]  INFO -- : process ID: 6106
    I, [2015-01-26T23:20:24.596335 #6106]  INFO -- : process privilege user: toki(1000)
    I, [2015-01-26T23:20:24.596985 #6106]  INFO -- : process privilege group: toki(1000)

If setup is success, empty mailbox named INBOX is shown at mail
account of your e-mail client.

Last, type Ctrl+C on your console to stop server.

### Mail delivery to mailbox

In this section, the way that you deliver mail to mailbox on RIMS is
described. Prepare a sample mail text file that is picked from your
e-mail client. The sample mail file is named `mail.txt` on description
of this section.

Simple way is that you use IMAP APPEND command. `rims` tool has IMAP
APPEND command. Type following on your console.

    $ bundle exec rims imap-append -v -n 192.168.56.101 -o 1430 -u foo -w bar mail.txt
    store flags: ()
    server greeting: OK RIMS vX.Y.Z IMAP4rev1 service ready.
    server capability: IMAP4REV1 UIDPLUS AUTH=PLAIN AUTH=CRAM-MD5
    login: OK LOGIN completed
    append: OK  APPEND completed

The option of `-v` is verbose mode. If you don't need display
information, no verbose option exists. If mail delivery is success,
you will see that message appears in INBOX on your e-mail client.

The advantage of IMAP APPEND is to be able to use it by any IMAP mail
server as well as RIMS. The disadvantage of IMAP APPEND is that it
requires your password. This may be insecure.

Special user is defined to deliver mail to any user's mailbox on RIMS.
By special user, it is possible to deliver mail without your password.
The disadvantage of special user is that it can be used only in RIMS.

At first, you prepare a special user to deliver mail. Type following
in configuration file. And start RIMS.

```yaml
user_list:
  - { user: foo, pass: bar }
  - { user: "#postman", pass: "#postman" }
```

And type following on your console.

    $ bundle exec rims post-mail -v -n 192.168.56.101 -o 1430 -w '#postman' foo mail.txt
    store flags: ()
    server greeting: OK RIMS vX.Y.Z IMAP4rev1 service ready.
    server capability: IMAP4REV1 UIDPLUS AUTH=PLAIN AUTH=CRAM-MD5
    login: OK LOGIN completed
    append: OK  APPEND completed

The option of `-v` is verbose mode. If you don't need display
information, no verbose option exists. If mail delivery is success,
you will see that message appears in INBOX on your e-mail client.

### IMAP well known port and server process privilege

Default port number of RIMS is 1430. IMAP protocol well known port
number is 143. If RIMS opens server socket with 143 port, it needs to
be root user process at unix. But RIMS doesn't need to be root user
process as IMAP server.

To open server socket with well known 143 port at RIMS:

1. RIMS starts at root user.
2. RIMS opens server socket with 143 port by root user privilege.
3. RIMS calls setuid(2). And privilege of process is changed from root
   user to another.
4. RIMS starts IMAP server with another's process privilege.

For example, port number is `imap2` (it is service name of well known
port of 143), process user privilege is `toki` (uid 1000), and process
group privilege is `toki` (gid 1000). Type following in configuration
file.

```yaml
user_list:
  - { user: foo, pass: bar }
  - { user: "#postman", pass: "#postman" }
imap_port: imap2
process_privilege_user: toki
process_privilege_group: toki
```

And type following on your console.

    $ sudo bundle exec rims server -f config.yml
    [sudo] password for toki: 
    I, [2015-01-31T21:32:30.069848 #9381]  INFO -- : start server.
    I, [2015-01-31T21:32:30.070068 #9381]  INFO -- : open socket: 0.0.0.0:imap2
    I, [2015-01-31T21:32:30.070374 #9381]  INFO -- : opened: [AF_INET][143][0.0.0.0][0.0.0.0]
    I, [2015-01-31T21:32:30.070559 #9381]  INFO -- : process ID: 9381
    I, [2015-01-31T21:32:30.070699 #9381]  INFO -- : process privilege user: toki(1000)
    I, [2015-01-31T21:32:30.070875 #9381]  INFO -- : process privilege group: toki(1000)

### Daemon

If RIMS server is started from console terminal, RIMS server process
is terminated on closing its console terminal.  At unix, server
process has to be started as daemon process for the server to keep
running its service.

RIMS server can start as daemon process. Type following on your
console.

    $ sudo bundle exec rims daemon start -f config.yml

`sudo` is required for well known 143 port (see previous section).
Daemon process is started quietly and prompt of console terminal is
returned immediately. But daemon process is running at background.
To see background daemon process, type following on your console.

    $ ps -elf | grep rims
    5 S root      3191  1720  0  80   0 - 23026 wait   21:10 ?        00:00:00 ruby /home/toki/rims/vendor/ruby/2.2.0/bin/rims daemon start -f config.yml
    5 S toki      3194  3191  0  80   0 - 26382 inet_c 21:10 ?        00:00:00 ruby /home/toki/rims/vendor/ruby/2.2.0/bin/rims daemon start -f config.yml

RIMS daemon is two processes. 1st root process is controller process.
2nd process that isn't root is server process. RIMS daemon doesn't
display messages and errors at console. You should see log files to
verify normal running of RIMS daemon.

To see log of controller process, watch syslog at system directory.
Type following on your console.

    $ tail -f /var/log/syslog
    Feb  1 21:10:00 vbox-linux rims-daemon[3191]: start daemon.
    Feb  1 21:10:00 vbox-linux rims-daemon[3191]: run server process: 3194

To see log of server process, watch imap.log at local directory. Type
following on your console.

    $ tail -f imap.log
    I, [2015-02-01T21:10:00.989859 #3194]  INFO -- : start server.
    I, [2015-02-01T21:10:00.990084 #3194]  INFO -- : open socket: 0.0.0.0:imap2
    I, [2015-02-01T21:10:00.990989 #3194]  INFO -- : opened: [AF_INET][143][0.0.0.0][0.0.0.0]
    I, [2015-02-01T21:10:00.991393 #3194]  INFO -- : process ID: 3194
    I, [2015-02-01T21:10:00.991615 #3194]  INFO -- : process privilege user: toki(1000)
    I, [2015-02-01T21:10:00.991703 #3194]  INFO -- : process privilege group: toki(1000)

RIMS daemon process can be controlled from command line tool. Defined
operations are start, stop, restart and status. Start operation is
already described.

Stop operation:

    $ sudo bundle exec rims daemon stop -f config.yml

Restart operation:

    $ sudo bundle exec rims daemon restart -f config.yml

Status operation:

    $ sudo bundle exec rims daemon status -f config.yml
    daemon is running.

    $ sudo bundle exec rims daemon status -f config.yml
    daemon is stopped.

Server Configuration
--------------------

Server options on start may be described at config.yml file.
Config.yml is a YAML format file and its contents are explained
at later.

To start server with config.yml file, type following.

    $ bundle exec rims server -f a_server_directory/config.yml

### Config.yml Parameters

  to this parameter group.  Default is 65534 (typical group ID of
  nogroup) and should be changed.</dd>
</dl>

Mailbox Data
------------

Mailbox data exists under the base directory. Next picture is a
overview of mailbox data filesystem under the base directory.

    a_base_directory
    |
    +-- mailbox.2/
        |
        +-- 2c/
            |
            +-- 26b46b68ffc68ff99b453c1d30413413422d706483bfa0f98a5e886266e7ae/
                |
                +-- message
                |
                +-- meta
                |
                +-- mailbox_1
                |
                +-- mailbox_2
                |
                ...

There is a MAILBOX\_DATA\_STRUCTURE\_VERSION directory under first
inside of the base directory.  When mailbox data structure will be
changed in future, MAILBOX\_DATA\_STRUCTURE\_VERSION directory will be
changed too.  Now latest version is "mailbox.2".

There are user directories under the MAILBOX\_DATA\_STRUCTURE\_VERSION
directory.  A user is identified by unique user ID.  Unique user ID is
a SHA256 HEX digest of a username.  For example, type following to
display a "foo" user's unique user ID.

    $ bundle exec rims unique-user-id foo
    2c26b46b68ffc68ff99b453c1d30413413422d706483bfa0f98a5e886266e7ae 

First two characters of unique user ID is used as a bucket directory.
Unique user ID substring from 3rd character to last exists as a user
directory under the bucket directory.  Shortcut tool to search a two
level directory of a user under a base directory exists.  For example,
type following to display a "foo" user's directory.

    $ bundle exec rims show-user-mbox a_base_directory foo
    a_base_directory/mailbox.2/2c/26b46b68ffc68ff99b453c1d30413413422d706483bfa0f98a5e886266e7ae

There are three types of files under the user directory.  Three types
are message, meta and mailbox.  Each file is key-value store.  Only
one type of key-value store is available now, it is GDBM.  A GDBM
key-value store file has a filename suffix, the suffix is ".gdbm".
Mailbox data does not depend on a specific type of key-value store.

### Message key-value store

Message key-value store file preserves all messages of a user.  Per
one user, only one file exists about this file type.  Contents of
message key-value store is simple.  A key is a message ID, and a value
is message text.  A message ID is a unique number of a message in RIMS
internal.  For example, type following to see overview of contents at
a message key-value store.

    $ bundle exec rims debug-dump-kvs --dump-size --no-dump-value a_base_directory/mailbox.2/2c/26b46b68ffc68ff99b453c1d30413413422d706483bfa0f98a5e886266e7ae/message
    "2": 21938 bytes
    "1": 126014 bytes
    "4": 22928 bytes
    "0": 6326 bytes
    "3": 65168 bytes

### Meta key-value store

Meta key-value store file preserves all meta data of message and
folders.  Per one user, only one file exists about this file type.
Contents of meta key-value store is complex, and only outline of
content is described here.

<dl>
  <dt>dirty</dt>
  <dd>Dirty flag. If enabled, this flag exists. If disabled, this flag
  doesn't exists. This flag will be enabled on updating mailbox
  data.</dd>

  <dt>cnum</dt>
  <dd>A change number of mailbox data. If mailbox data is modified,
  this number is increased.</dd>

  <dt>msg_id</dt>
  <dd>The next number of message ID. Message ID is unique number of
  message in RIMS internal.</dd>

  <dt>uidvalidity</dt>
  <dd>The next number of uidvalidity. Uidvalidity is unique number of
  mailbox in IMAP.</dd>

  <dt>mbox_set</dt>
  <dd>Mailbox set of a user.</dd>

  <dt>mbox_id2name-#</dt>
  <dd>Mapping from mailbox ID to mailbox name.</dd>

  <dt>mbox_name2id-#</dt>
  <dd>Mapping from mailbox name to mailbox ID.</dd>

  <dt>mbox_id2uid-#</dt>
  <dd>The next uid at a mailbox. Uid is unique number of message at a
  mailbox in IMAP.</dd>

  <dt>mbox_id2msgnum-#</dt>
  <dd>Number of messages at a mailbox.</dd>

  <dt>mbox_id2flagnum-#-#</dt>
  <dd>Number of flags at a mailbox.</dd>

  <dt>msg_id2date-#</dt>
  <dd>Mapping from message ID to internal date of a message. Internal
  date is a message attribute in IMAP.</dd>

  <dt>msg_id2flag-#</dt>
  <dd>Set of flags at a message.</dd>

  <dt>msg_id2mbox-#</dt>
  <dd>Mapping from message ID to mailbox's uid.</dd>
</dl>

### Mailbox key-value store

Mailbox key-value store file preserves key-value pairs of uid and
message ID.  Per one user, plural files exist about this type of file
because plural mailboxes are allowed at one user.  Mailbox key-value
store filenames are "mailbox\_1", "mailbox\_2", ...  And 1,2,... are
mailbox ID.  Contents of mailbox key-value store is simple.  A key is
a uid, and a value is message ID.  A uid is a unique number of a
message in a mailbox in IMAP.  A message ID is a unique number of a
message in RIMS internal.  For example, type following to see overview
of contents at a mailbox key-value store.

    $ bundle exec rims debug-dump-kvs a_base_directory/mailbox.2/2c/26b46b68ffc68ff99b453c1d30413413422d706483bfa0f98a5e886266e7ae/mailbox_1
    "2": 1 bytes: "1"
